# GstDots

Watches for GStreamer .dot files in a local path and displays them in a browser.

## How to use it

This tool uses the `GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR` environment variable to locate the dot
files generated by GStreamer and defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_DIR/gstreamer-dots/` if it is not set.

You can simply run it with:
```sh
cargo run
```

Browse to `http://localhost:3000` and wait for the graphs to appear as you use your
GStreamer application. The web page is refreshed everytime a new `.dot`` file is found
in the path pointed by the `GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR` env var.
